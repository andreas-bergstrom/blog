- Title, should be called "Learn Python by making games"
- Beginners to programming in general
- Beginner-centric. People mastering basics of Python will not find much of value other than perhaps the Pygame-content.
- Start with basic command line games, ends with graphical games using Python
- 2/3 of the book text-based games, the last 1/3 pygame
- Focuses on a few new featuers per chapter/game, instead of confusing the beginner with loads of classes and functions before they've understood the basics of programming and python
- Introduces more advanced concepts of Python along with more complex games
- Code for a game, walks through line by line and discusses new techniques and concepts. Make heavy use of the REPL to illustrate usage and encourage the reader to experiment
- flowcharts, debugging, python conventions, 3rd party packages, 
- Describe chapter by chapter or grouped, "first x chapters"
- Avoids best-practice and the usage of standard library functionality for the sake of simplicity, such as avoiding random.choice at first. Concepts introduced only as needed
- Recommended to who? Beginner to programming in general, programmers with expericence from other books will be bored
